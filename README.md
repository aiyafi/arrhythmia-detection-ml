# Arrhythmia Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect arrhythmia using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features related to heart activity and is processed to train a machine learning model for classification.

## Dataset Description

Arrhythmia, or arrhythmia, is a symptom of a heart rate or rhythm disorder. It can be felt when the heart beats faster than normal, known as tachycardia, or when the heart beats slower than normal, known as bradycardia. This project uses a dataset that includes various features related to heart activity to detect arrhythmia.

## Project Structure

- **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn.
- **Import Dataset**: Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Process the dataset by naming columns, checking for missing values, and summarizing the data.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the MLPClassifier from sklearn.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data using seaborn and matplotlib.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `ARRHYTHMIA_DETECTION_ML.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Results

The model is trained to classify arrhythmia based on the features provided in the dataset. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
